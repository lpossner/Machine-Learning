## Setup

All notebooks use relative paths (`./data/`) for data files. Ensure datasets are placed in a `data/` directory at the same level as the notebooks.

## Requirements

Common dependencies include:
- PyTorch / TensorFlow / Keras
- scikit-learn
- pandas, numpy
- transformers (for NLP tasks)

Install specific requirements as needed per notebook.
